# Fractals Alert

Fractals Alert is an indicator for MT4 and MT5 by EarnForex.com. It is based on the standard Fractals indicator developed by Bill Williams. It draws arrows at the time points where a Fractal arrow is first detected or is finalized. This indicator supports all types of alerts.

When set to work on a Previous Candle, it is a non-repainting indicator.

The indicator is highly customizable via its input parameters.
